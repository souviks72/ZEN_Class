The DOM, or Document Object Model is a programming API for HTML documents. 
It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a HTML document is 
parsed and manipulated. With the help of the DOM we can parse the HTML files in javascript
and manipulate the various elements of the webpage. The DOM gives us an interface
to interact and manipulate the webpage, this includes changing the structure and style,
listening for events like hover, click, keypress, etc.

The DOM is created as a tree data strucutre, because of various resons like:
1. accessing child elements quickly
2. elements can be accessed without index
3. worst case time complexity is reduced
4. if parent element is deleted, its children are removed automatically,
    if it had been an array then we oud have to remove the children manually,
    and there would have been empty spaces in the array
5. the tree data structure allowa us to travel from one node to its child, parent, sibling
    all in one step
