Cross Origin Resource Sharing or CORS is a mechanism that uses additional HTTP
headers to tell browsers to give a web application running at one origin,access
to selected resources at a different origin(domain,protocol,or port) from its own.

This is used as a security mechanism to prevent others to inject code in the website.

AUTHENTICATION

This is a very common feature seen in many websites and almost all Social Media Networks- the signup/login system. This way the user's personal data and activity
will not be visible to others andothers won't be able to pose as another user or
maliciously use another user's account.
