Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a <p> tag indicates that the enclosed
text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational because people know what paragraphs are, and browsers know how to display them.
On the flip side of this equation, tags such as <b> and <i> are not semantic. They define only how the text should look (bold or italic), 
and don't provide any additional meaning to the markup.

Examples include <aside>, <main>, <section>, <footer>, <code> and <blockquote>.
The benefit of writing semantic HTML stems from what should be the driving goal of any web page: the desire to communicate. By adding semantic tags to your document
you provide additional information about that document, which aids in communication. Specifically, semantic tags make it clear to the browser what the meaning of a page
 and its content is. That clarity is also communicated with search engine, making sure that the right pages are delivered for the right queries. It also makes easier
 for screen readers to read the page for people using them.
